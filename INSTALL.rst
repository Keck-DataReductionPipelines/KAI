INSTALLATION GUIDE
------------------

Make sure the python paths point to the appropriate code directories. For example, this can be done by using setup.py:

``python setup.py install``

Or manually putting in the path to the repository in your ``.bash_profile``, such as:

``export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/KAI``
