          square of the 1-D Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)^2 of
          an optical system consisting of a 
          telescope + detector + atmosphere + Adaptive Optics (AO) system.

                              SPDIST=SPDIST])

   INPUTS:
          NU:   The spatial frequencies at which the MTF will be
          computed, in normalized units (i.e. nu=1 at spatial frequency

          regularly gridded.

          PARAMS:   A structure of parameters defined as follows:

                    params.lambda  - wavelength in meters of the

                                     D/lambda; not necessarily 10
                                     meters for Keck! (see PROCEDURE
                                     below)   
                    params.A       - width of detector pixel in meters,

                                     field.
                    params.pupil   - a string equal to the name of

                                     T_PERFECT_KECK for a list of
                                     available pupil-stop names) or for
                                     a circular pupil, the scalar
                                     floating point value of the
                                     pupil's central obscuration.  The
                                     data type of this parameter
                                     deterimines the form of the pupil
                                     MTF used (see PROCEDURE below).
                    params.L0      - the outer scale of turbluence, in

                    params.sigma   - the width of the AO system

                                     influence function as projected
                                     onto the pupil plane, in meters.
                    params.w       - scaling factor for the influence
                                     function's Fourier transform;
                                     mimics variable AO correction (see
                                     documentation for
                                     FT_INFL_FUNCTION) 
                    params.delta   - wavefront measurement error
                    params.cmult   - constant scaling factor of the output
                                     MTF
                    params.N       - additive constant to output MTF
                                     representing a noise floor
                    params.r0      - wavelength specific Fried
                                     parameter in meters (see PROCEDURE
                                     below). 

   KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
          SPDIST: Set this keyword to a vector the same size as nu, the
                  1-D power spectrum of the source distribution power
                  spectrum of an image for which you wish to fit an
                  MTF.  The output (MTF)^2 is multiplied by this vector
                  before output.
          /PERF:  If this keyword is set, RESULT is the square of the
                  diffraction limited pupil MTF. 
          /ATMOS_AO:   If this keyword is set, RESULT is the square of
                  the AO filtered atmospheric MTF.
          /PIX    Returns the MTF^2 of an ideal pixel.
          _EXTRA: Use this keyword to pass in a structure containing
                  constant parameters that need not be recomputed each
                  time MTFFUNC_KECK is called.  This is useful for
                  speeding up an iterative fitting procedure that uses
                  MTFFUNC_KECK.  The structure passed in via this
                  keyword must contain the following parameters/tags:

                   _EXTRA = {lambda:lambda, f:f, D:D, pupil:pupil, $
                             A:A, TPERF:TPERF, SPDIST:SPDIST}

                  where lambda, f, D, A, and pupil are definted exactly
                  as they are for input via PARAMS; TPERF is a vector
                  of size equal to NU and is the diffraction limited
                  pupil MTF (N.B., not the squared MTF) and is
                  equivalent to the square root of the output of
                  MTFFUNC_KECK with the /PERF keyword set; SPDIST is
                  the power spectrum of and image's source distribution
                  function, identical to SPDIST.  

                  If the keyword _EXTRA is set to this structure,
                  then PARAMS must not be a structure containing all of
                  the parameters defined in PARAMS above, but must be a
                  7 element vector defined as such:

                  PARAMS[0] = L0, PARAMS[1] = sigma, PARAMS[2] = w,
                   PARAMS[3] = delta, PARAMS[4] = cmult, PARAMS[5]= N,
                    PARAMS[6] = r0.

                  Setting the keyword SPDIST
                  overrides the source distribution power spectrum
                  passed in via the _EXTRA keyword.  If the _EXTRA
                  keyword is not set and a structure of parameters is
                  passed in via PARAMS, then SPDIST is the only way to
                  multiply the output of MTFFUNC_KECK by a vector
                  before returning.

   OUTPUTS:
          RESULT:  The (MTF)^2, evaluated at the input spatial
          frequencies, NU.

   RESTRICTIONS:
          NU must be greater than zero.  

   PROCEDURE CALLS:
          T_ATMOS_AO(), T_PIX(), T_PERFECT_KECK(), T_PERFECT()

   PROCEDURE:
          If PARAMS.pupil is a string, it must specify the pupil stop
          name of the NIRC2 camera that was in place at the time of the
          observation.  See the documentation for NIRC2PUPIL for a list
          of acceptable pupil stop names.  In this case, the pupil MTF
          is numerically calculated as the autocorrelation function of
          the Keck pupil via the procedure T_PERFECT_KECK.

          If PARAMS.pupil is a floating point scalar, the pupil MTF is
          calculated analytically via the procedure T_PERFECT for a
          circular pupil with central obscuration PARAMS.pupil.  (See
          the documentation for T_PERFECT.)  This functionality is not
          intended for use with Keck AO data, but is included in the
          event this software is applied to data from other AO systems,
          such as the Lick 3-meter telescope.

          PARAMS.delta is untested, and for the time being should be
          left set to zero.

          In general PARAMS.D should not be set to the familiar 10
          meters, which is the effective diameter of the Keck pupil.
          Since this parameter defines the maximum spatial frequency
          D/lambda to which the telescope is sensitive, it should be
          equal to the diameter of the circle inscribing the Keck
          pupil.  This is because the lambda/D minimum angle changes
          depending on orientation in the image plane, and in certain
          orientations the diameter appropriate for this specification
          is D = 10.99 m.

          r0 is the wavelength specific Fried parameter.  Generally,
          the r0 specifying seeing conditions is quoted for a
          wavelength of 500 nm.  If one has reason to believe that the
          r0 for a set of observations is 20 cm, then the wavelength
          specific r0 is given as
              r0_lambda = r0 * (lambda/500 nm)^(6/5)
          and this is the r0 that should be specified in PARAMS.RO.

          The effective focal length at the detector, PARAMS.F, is
          related to the platescale of the detector by
              F = Apix / platescale
          where platescale is in radians / pixel.  If the platescale
          and the pixel size is accurately known, F should be
          calculated in this manner.

   EXAMPLE:
          Generate a model MTF for an H-band NIRC2 image at the .01
          arcsec/pixel platescale at normalized spatial fequencies in
          the image plane from 0 to 1:

          params={lambda:1.6e-6, F:557.0, D:10.99,  $
                  L0:30.0, sigma:0.56, w:1.5, delta:0.0, cmult:1.0, $
                  N:1e-4, r0:0.65, Apix:27e-6, pupil:'largehex'}
          nu = findgen(100)/99.
          tsys_squared = mtffunc_keck(nu,params)

   NAME:
        FITMTF_KECK

   PURPOSE:
        Uses MPFIT to perform a constrained Levenberg-Markwardt fit of
        a model MTF to data from a Keck adaptive optics image.  It is
        highly recommended that the user edit this procedure to suit
        his or her particular needs, i.e. changing the default initial
        guesses for the fit parameters and the step size to MPFIT.

        This procedure is meant as a guide to illustrate how to use
        MPFIT in conjunction with the AO MTF software.  Just because
        MPFIT returns best fit parameters does not mean that it has
        found an absolute minimum in Chi-squared.  As with most
        non-linear fit routines, some tinkering may be required to
        avoid local minima and to obtain accurate fits.  In other
        words, this procedure should not be applied blindly.

        In general, a good way to obtain accurate fits is to first
        perform the fits with decent starting guesses for the fit
        parameters and specifying a relatively large step size over
        which MPFIT calculates the numerical derivative of the fit
        function w.r.t. the fit parameters.  Once the best fit
        parameters are obtained from this iteration, the step
        size can be decreased and the best fit parameters from the
        first iteration should be used as the starting guesses for the
        parameters in the second iteration.  

        A good rule of thumb that seems to work in some (many?) cases
        is specifying the step size in the first iteration to be 20% of the
        parameters' respective values, and a step size of 2% in the
        second interation.  This can be accomplished by changing the
        values of PARINFO[*].relstep from 0.20 to 0.02 within the
        procedure or via the RELSTEP keyword defined at the main
        level. Different step sizes for different parameters can be
        specified by editing PARINFO[*].relstep within the procedure.

   CATEGORY:
        ???

   CALLING SEQUENCE:
        FITMTF_KECK, filename, params, perror, covar, chisq, $
                     [start=start, relstep=relstep, quiet=quiet]

   INPUTS:
        FILENAME: A scalar string specifying the filename of an IDL
                  save file containing the data to which the model MTF
                  is fit.  The command
                        restore, FILENAME
                  must restore the variables NU, POWER, ERROR, and
                  SPDIST, which are vectors of equal size.  These
                  variables are the outputs of the routine GETMTF.

   KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        START:   Set this keyword equal to a structure containing
                 starting guesses for the fit parameters as defined in
                 the documentation for MTFFUNC_KECK.  If not set, they
                 the default values must be defined within the
                 procedure.  

        CLIP:    Set this keyword equal to a scalar value defining the
                 normalized spatial frequency (defined by NU) below
                 which the data restored from FILENAME will be ignored.
                 By default, this value is None (no clipping).  
                 Setting CLIP = 0.0 fits all of the data.  
                 However, this is generally not
                 recommended because imperfect sky subtraction of the
                 image from which NU and POWER were computed usually
                 contaminates the power spectrum at low spatial
                 frequencies. The recommended value is 0.02.

        RELSTEP: Defines the relative step size over which MPFIT
                 computes the numerical derivative of Chi-sqared
                 w.r.t. the fit parameters.  Sets the value
                 PARINFO[*].relstep, which is an input to MPFIT (see
                 the documentation for MPFIT).

        /QUIET : Set this keyword to supress the printed output of
                 MPFIT.  Generally, though, it is good practice to keep
                 tabs on what MPFIT is doing as it's proceding with the
                 fit.  

   OUTPUTS:
        PARAMS:  A structure of the best fit parameters as determined
                 by MPFIT; can be used as the input parameters to
                 MTFFUNC_KECK, MTF2PSF, MTF2EE, or any of
                 MTFFUNC_KECK's subsidiary routines.  

                 The parameters that are fit are L0, sigma, w,
                 delta, cmult, N, and r0.  The rest are only supplied
                 as information to MTFFUNC_KECK.  In addition, some of
                 these fit parameters may be held constant if they are
                 known or assumed (SIMGA and DELTA are held fixed by 
                 default when performing the fit).  Constant parameters
                 are specified by setting PARINFO[i].fixed to 1 within
                 the FITMTF_KECK procedure (see documentation for
                 MPFIT and MPFITFUN).

        PERROR:  A structure of formal error in the best fit
                 parameters, as determined by MPFIT.  Parameters that
                 are not included in the fit or are held fixed during
                 the fit return an error of 0.

        COVAR:   The parameter covariance matrix, of size N x N, where
                 N is the number of fit parameters supplied to MPFIT,
                 the values of which depend on the order of the vector
                 of input parameters supplied to MPFIT.  (See
                 documentation for MPFIT and order of FCNARGS as
                 defined within this procedure.)

        CHISQ:   The quantity (RESIDS/ERROR)^2, where 
                 RESIDS = POWER - BESTFIT, and POWER and ERROR are
                 the vectors restored from FILENAME (see above).
                 CHISQ is calculated ignoring data at NU < CLIP. 

        NITER:   Number of iterations performed by the fitting routine.

   PROCEDURE CALLS:
        MPFITFUN, MPFIT, T_PERFECT_KECK

        read in a fully reduced H-band NIRC2 image

          diffraction limited MTF of the segmented Keck pupil,
          appropriate for the NIRC2 camera. 

   CATEGORY:
          ???

   CALLING SEQUENCE:
          RESULT = T_PERFECT_KECK(NU, D, [PUPIL=PUPIL])

   INPUTS:
          NU:  Normalized spatial frequency in the image plane, in
               units of D/lambda.

          D:   The diameter of the Keck pupil, in meters, to which the
               spatial frequencies are normalized, i.e. not necessarily
               the oft-quoted effective diameter of 10 meters.  
               If D is a scalar or a 1-element array, this value is
               used.  Otherwise D must be a structure with the tag "D"
               defined, as per the definition of PARAMS in
               MTFFUNC_KECK. 

   KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
          PUPIL:      Set this keyword to a string to select the
                      NIRC2 pupil-stop.  Available choices are

                      If this keyword is not set, the default pupil is
                      'LARGEHEX'. (See documentation for NIRC2PUPIL.)

   OUTPUTS:
          RESULT:  The diffraction limited MTF (N.B. not the square of
          the MTF).

   PROCEDURE:
          1) Retrieves a pupil image from NIRC2PUPIL
          2) Computes the 2-D autocorrelation function of the pupil
          3) Radially bins and averages the 2-D autocorrelation
             function into a 1-D MTF.
          4) Interpoates the 1-D MTF onto the grid of normalized
             spatial frequencies, NU, defined by the user.

   "
   NAME: 
        DIST_CIRCLE
   PURPOSE:      
        Form a square array where each value is its distance to a given center.
   EXPLANATION:
        Returns a square array in which the value of each element is its 
        distance to a specified center. Useful for circular aperture photometry.

   CALLING SEQUENCE:
        DIST_CIRCLE, IM, N, [ XCEN, YCEN,  /DOUBLE ]

   INPUTS:
        N = either  a scalar specifying the size of the N x N square output
                 array, or a 2 element vector specifying the size of the
                 N x M rectangular output array.

   OPTIONAL INPUTS:
        XCEN,YCEN = Scalars designating the X,Y pixel center.  These need
                 not be integers, and need not be located within the
                 output image.   If not supplied then the center of the output
                 image is used (XCEN = YCEN = (N-1)/2.).

   OUTPUTS:
         IM  - N by N (or M x N) floating array in which the value of each 
                 pixel is equal to its distance to XCEN,YCEN

   OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORD:
         /DOUBLE - If this keyword is set and nonzero, the output array will
                 be of type DOUBLE rather than floating point.

   EXAMPLE:
         Total the flux in a circular aperture within 3' of a specified RA
         and DEC on an 512 x 512 image IM, with a header H.

                 IDL> adxy, H, RA, DEC, x, y       Convert RA and DEC to X,Y
         IDL> getrot, H, rot, cdelt        CDELT gives plate scale deg/pixel
         IDL> cdelt = cdelt*3600.          Convert to arc sec/pixel
         IDL> dist_circle, circle, 512, x, y  ;Create a distance circle image
         IDL> circle = circle*abs(cdelt[0])   ;Distances now given in arcseconds
         IDL> good = where(circle LT 180)  ;Within 3 arc minutes
         IDL> print,total( IM[good] )      Total pixel values within 3'

   RESTRICTIONS:
         The speed of DIST_CIRCLE decreases and the the demands on virtual
         increase as the square of the output dimensions.   Users should
         dimension the output array as small as possible, and re-use the
         array rather than re-calling DIST_CIRCLE

   MODIFICATION HISTORY:
         Adapted from DIST    W. Landsman            March 1991
         Allow a rectangular output array   W. Landsman     June 1994

   NAME:
          PHI_ATMOS_AO

   PURPOSE:
          Calculates the AO filtered atmospheric power spectrum for
          spatial frequencies in the pupil plane, Phi_AO = Phi*(1-H)^2
          where Phi is the unfiltered atmospheric power spectrum and H
          is the Fourier transform of the deformable mirror's (DM's)
          influence function.  The default behavior is to use modified
          Kolmogorov power spectrum with finite outer scale and the
          influence function for the Keck AO system's DM.

   CATEGORY:
          ???

   CALLING SEQUENCE:
          Result = PHI_ATMOS_AO(KAPPA, PARAMS, [unmod=unmod, tat=tat])

   INPUTS:
          KAPPA:  A vector of spatial frequencies in the pupil plane,
                  in m^-1
          PARAMS: A structure of parameters as defined in the
                  documentation for MTFFUNC_KECK 

   KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
          /UNMOD: Set this keyword to use an unmodified Kolmogorov
                  atmospheric power spectrum, i.e. with an infinite
                  outer scale.
          /TAT:   Set this keyword to use a modified Tatarski power
                  spectrum, i.e. one with both a finite outer scale
                  and finite inner scale (WARNING: UNTESTED).  If this
                  keyword is invoked, the PARAMS structure must contain
                  an extra tag, "Inner:", that is the inner scale of
                  turbulence in meters.

   OUTPUTS:
          Result: The AO filtered atmospheric power spectrum, of
                  evaluated at and the same size as KAPPA.

   RESTRICTIONS:
          If the /UNMOD keyword is set, an input KAPPA of zero will
          cause a divide by 0 error, and RESULT will be Infinity,
          because the power at zero spatial frequency for an infinite
          outer scale is infinity.

          Works for the Keck DM's influence function.  If the user
          wishes to use a different influence function, replace the
          call to FT_INFL_FUNC within the routine with another
          function that returns the Fourier transform of the
          appropriate influence function.  This function should take as
          inputs KAPPA and PARAMS (the user may add other tags to the
          PARAMS structure as necessary) and return the FT of the
          influence function as projected onto the pupil plane,
          evaluated at the inpute KAPPA.

                   turbulence in meters.

   OUTPUTS:
          RESULT:  The Kolmogorov atmospheric power spectrum, of same
                   size as input KAPPA.

   RESTRICTIONS:
          If the /UNMOD keyword is set, an input KAPPA of zero will
          cause a divide by 0 error, and RESULT will be Infinity,
          because the power at zero spatial frequency for an infinite

   PROCEDURE:
          1) The Kolmogorov spectrum with inifinte outer scale is
             calculated.  If the /UNMOD keyword is set, this is
             immediately returned.
          2) The Kolmogorov spectrum with finite outer scale is
             calculated.  Since the power at spatial scales much less
             than the outer scale should be left unaffected, the
             spectrum is normalized to have the same power at a very
             high spatial frequency, 100 m^-1.

    OUTPUTS:
           Result:  The FT of the influence function, evaluated at and
                    of the same size as KAPPA.  The output is multiplied
                    by W before output.  W=2 gives perfect AO correction
                    at zero spatial frequency.

    PROCEDURE:
           The FT of the influence function has a set functional form,
           the difference of two Gaussians, and depends only on the
           parameter SIGMA (as defined in PARAMS) that is on the order
           of the separation between DM actuators.

           The result is multiplied by a constant scaling factor w, defined in

                      spectrum with a finite outer scale and corrected
                      by adaptive optics.  If the user wishes to find
                      D(r) for a different power spectrum, PHI_CALL
                      should be a string that, as executed, calls an IDL
                      function that returns the power spectrum for 
                      input spatial frequencies KAPPA (as defined in the
                      documentation for PHI_ATMOS/PHI_ATMOS_AO).
                      This function must be structured as follows:

                          FUNCTION MYFUNCT, KAPPA, PARAMS, KEYWORDS=...
                            (compute the atmospheric power spectrum PHI
                             at given X for input parameters PARAMS)
                             RETURN, PHI
                          END

                      The PARAMS input to the function is the same
                      structure as the PARAMS input into STRUC_FUNC.

                      PHI_CALL MUST HAVE 'k' AS THE SPATIAL FREQUENCY
                      VARIABLE NAME 'k' AND 'p' AS THE PARAMETER
                      STRUCTURE VARAIBLE NAME!

                      Example: The function PHI_ATMOS returns the
                      uncorrected atmospheric power spectrum, and would
                      be called as such:

                          IDL> x=findgen(10)
                          IDL> phi=PHI_ATMOS(x,params)

                      where params has already been defined and is a
                      structure containing information for PHI_ATMOS to
                      be able to calculate the power spectrum.  In the
                      call to STRUC_FUNC, setting the keyword

                          PHI_CALL = 'PHI_ATMOS(k,p)'

                      forces STRUC_FUNC to use this power spectrum in
                      calculating D(r).  

                      PHI_ATMOS also accepts keywords     for instance

                          IDL> phi=PHI_ATMOS(x,params,/unmod)

                      returns an uncorrected power spectrum with an
                      infinite outer scale.  In this case, one would set
                      the keyword

                          PHI_CALL = 'PHI_ATMOS(k,p,/unmod)'

                      Leaving the keyword PHI_CALL undefined is
                      equivalent to setting

                          PHI_CALL = 'PHI_ATMOS_AO(k,p)

    OUTPUTS:
           RESULT:  A vector of same size as R, the structure function
           evaluated at R

          Size:     A scalar, the radius of the output PSF in
                    arcseconds.  For instance, is Size = 1.0 and the
                    platescale at the detector is .01 arcsec/pixel, the
                    output PSF is a 200 x 200 element array.

   OPTIONAL INPUTS:
          NONE

   KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
          /PERF:   If this keyword is set, the PSF is calculated from
                   the diffraction limited pupil MTF.

   OUTPUTS:
          Psf2D:   A 2-dimensional array, the azimuthally averaged AO
                   PSF. 

   OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
          Psf1D:   A 1-dimensional array, the 1-D PSF whose value at
                   each element corresponds to the value of the PSF at
                   the corresponding pixel.

   PROCEDURE CALLS:
          MTFFUNC_KECK(), INT_TABULATED()

   PROCEDURE:
          For the given input parameters Params, the 1-D MTF is
          computed via the procedure MTFFUNC_KECK.  The 1-D PSF is 
          then given by the integral
                    1/
            PSF(w) = | MTF(nu) * nu * BesselJ_0(2*PI*w*nu)* d nu,
                    0/
          where w is dimensionless angular distance from the PSF center
          in units of (lambda/D), and nu is normalized spatial
          frequency in the image plane.  The 1-D PSF is computed,
          5x oversampled w.r.t. the detector platescale.  (The
          platescale is determined from the input parameters, 
          Apix / f.)  From this oversampled 1-D PSF, the circularly
          symmetric 2-D PSF is constructed.

   EXAMPLE:
          Compute H-band NIRC2 PSF for r0 = 15 cm:

          r0 goes as (lambda)^(6/5), so the K-band r0 in meters is
          0.15 * (2.2 / 0.5)^(6./5.), since r0 = 15 cm is defined for a
          wavelength of 500 nm.

          Set up the input parameters:

          p    =   {wave:2.2e-6, F:557.0, D:10.99, $
                    Apix:27e-6, pupil:'largehex', L0:30.0, $
                    sigma:0.56, w:1.5, delta:0.0, cmult:1.0, N:1e-5, $
                    r0:0.888}        
          sz = 1.0      return a PSF with a radius of 1 arcsecond
          MTF2PSF, p, sz, psf2, psf1
          tvscl, psf2
          plot, psf1

          nu = findgen(100)/99.
          T = sqrt(MTFFUNC_KECK(nu, p))     compute the PSF's corresponding MTF
          plot, nu, T

              compute the PSF for identical seeing conditions but with no
              AO correction
          p.w = 0        no AO correction 
          MTF2PSF, p, sz, psf2_noAO, psf1_noAO  

              compute the diffraction limited PSF
          MTF2PSF, p, sz, psf2_perf, psf1_perf, /perf

          There is a subtle difference between setting the /perf
          keyword to MTF2PSF and setting r0 to some extremely large
          and unphysical value to mimic diffraction limited seeing.
          The former computes the PSF from the pupil MTF, while the
          latter uses the product of the puipl MTF, the atmospheric/AO
          MTF (which is essentially unity) and the detector MTF.  The
          detector MTF is a broad sinc function, and its resulting
          effect on the PSF is small.  In other words, setting the
          /perf keyword fails to take into account the effect of the
          detector on the PSF.
